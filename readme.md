# Personal Progress

Should be able to get started on this properly around May 2021.

## Goals: 

#### Clear all recommended paths.

* **Game Programming for Kids**: Can be skipped. Reason: age, experience.
* **Computer Science**: Can be skipped for now. Reason: college.
* **Programming Languages**: Can be skipped for now. Reason: Been using C# + Unity for over a year now.
* **Software Development**: Overlaps with web dev.
    1. Code Complete 2 : **0%**
    2. Clean Code : **0%**
    3. Design Patterns : **0%**
* **Mathematics for Game Programming** : Extremely foundational and important.
    1. Mathematics for 3D Game Programming & Computer Graphics: **0%**
    2. Geometric Tools for Computer Graphics: **0%**
    3. Computational Geometry: **0%**
* **Game Programming**: Can be partially skipped. Reason: experience.
    1. Game Programming Patterns: **50%**
* **Game Engine Development**: Can be skimmed a bit. Reason: not my interest.
* **Computer Graphics**: Really love this field.
    1. OpenGL Programming Guide: **0%**
    2. Fundamentals of Computer Graphics: **0%**
    3. Real-time Rendering: **0%** 
    4. Physically Based Rendering: **0%**
    5. 
* **Game Audio Programming**: Can be skipped. Reason: not my interest.
* **Game Physics and Animation**: Medium level of interest in physics part.
    1. +2 Level Physics for fundamentals (Rigidbodies, Light, etc.) : **0%**
* **Game Artificial Intelligence**: Medium level of interest.
    1. Artificial Intelligence for Games: **0%**
    2. Artificial Intelligence Modern Approach: **0%**
* **Multiplayer Game Programming**: Really love this field.
    1. Multiplayer Game Development 2015: **0%**

#### Extended Path Completion

These may be done after 80% of all recommended paths are complete, and 100% of the corresponding recommended path is complete.
 
* **Multiplayer Game Programming** : I want to specialize in this field.
    * Multiplayer Online Game Development and Deployment: **Vol 0 / 9** 
    * TCP/IP Illustrated 1: **0%**
    * Unix Network Programming: **0%**
    * Beej's Guide to Network Programming: **0%**
* **Game Programming** : This is a huge undertaking. It would be okay to skip some recipes if others are implemented for practice.
    * Game Programming Gems 1-8 : **0/8**
* **Game AI**
    * AI Game Programming Wisdom (Article-based): **0 Chapters Read** ; **0 Chapters Implemented**
    * Game AI Pro (Article-based): **0 Chapters Read** ; **0 Chapters Implemented**
* **Computer Graphics**
    * Digital Image Processing (skim for perspective into this application of cg) : **0%**
    * GPU Gems (Article-based): **0 Chapters Read** ; **0 Chapters Implemented**
    * GPU Pros (Article-based): **0 Chapters Read** ; **0 Chapters Implemented**
    * GPU Zen (Article-based): **0 Chapters Read** ; **0 Chapters Implemented**
* **Game Physics/Animation**
    * Physics Modelling for Game Programmers: **0%**
    * The Nature of Code: **0%**
    * Physics Based Animation: **0%**
    * Game Inverse Kinematics: **0%**
    * Game Physics Engine Development: **0%**
    * Game Physics 2nd Ed 2010 : **0%**
* **Game Engine Programming** : Don't have huge interest in this, but I may be interested in tools dev.
    * Game Development Tools: **0%**
* **Mathematics** : Should look into some fields that I'm interested in.
    1. Div, grad, curl, and all that: **0%**
    2. Geometric Algebra for Computer Science: **0%**
* **Computer Science**: Was entirely skipped before due to college, but may be studied with more rigour now after other full paths are done-ish, since we'll probably be diving deeper into code now.
    1. Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) : **0%**
    2. Computer Systems (CSAPP) : **0%**
    3. Computer Architecture (CAAQA) : **0%**
    4. Introduction to Algorithsm (CLRS) : **20%**
